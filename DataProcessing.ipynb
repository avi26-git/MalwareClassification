    "The purpose of this term project is to demonstrate your practical skills in implementing and deploying machine learning models for malware classification. The technical implementation of this project is comprised of three main tasks that need to be completed sequentially:\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 1 - Training: In this task, you will be creating and training a deep neural network based on the MalConv architecture to classify PE files as malware or benign. As for the dataset, you will be using the EMBER-2017 v2 ( https://github.com/endgameinc/ember ).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you explore the EMBER repository, you will find that it comes with a sample implementation of MalConv ( https://github.com/endgameinc/ember/tree/master/malconv ). This sample is a wonderful resource to base your implementation on. However, note that this code is 2 years (i.e., a lifetime in ML) old, and does not precisely conform to the requirements of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation: The model must be implemented in Python 3.x using TensorFlow (1.x or 2.x) and Keras, and needs to be coded and documented in a Jupyter Notebook. Additionaly, add textual description blocks to the notebook to document and explain the different parts of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training: This model may take a long time to train on your personal computers (from 7-8 hours to a couple of days, depending on the config), unless you already have a powerful NVIDIA GPU (1080 TI or better). Alternatively, you can use the cloud platforms to speed up the training: Google Colab or AWS Sagemaker.\n"
